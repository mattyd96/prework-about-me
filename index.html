      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm an aspiring Web Developer. I have a background in Computer Science, but haven't been able to dive Into
        this area to much, but i'm looking forward to it! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Riverside California originally but moved to Australia in 2007.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Snowboarding, Building custom mechanical keyboards, and studying languages (Japanese and Korean atm).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that lets me travel a lot</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Adelaide</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Not only do I find it fun to work with and it's a great feeling when you finally solve a pesky problem, but
        also the amount of flexiblity this kind of work offers is great. I was fortunate enough to
        meet some people who were able to fund their travel around the world just by freelancing. I'm not sure
        I want to go that far, but I would love to have the option.
