      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm an aspiring Web Developer. I have a background in Computer Science, but haven't been able to dive Into
        this area too much. I'm looking forward to the course! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Riverside California originally but moved to Australia in 2007.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Snowboarding, Building custom mechanical keyboards, and studying languages (Japanese and Korean atm).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that lets me travel a lot</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Adelaide</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For one the work is fun. I like the accomplishment after solving problems that have been plaguing 
        me for hours, and I guess that is what brought me around to programming in the first place; but web development
        specifically caught my eye because I love what you can make with it, be it this static website or a little Javascript app.
        I figured if I can get a fraction of that enjoyment in a professional environment, it would be a great job.
        On top of that there is (or seems to be) a huge amount of opportunity and flexibilty that comes with this 
        skill set. Being able to freeelance and travel or getting to work at a huge variety of companies is really exciting.
